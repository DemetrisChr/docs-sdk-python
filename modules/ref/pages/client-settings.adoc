The Python SDK may be configured using the connection string when instantiating a [.api]`Cluster` object.

== Timeout Options

// TODO: update to couchbase.bucket.Bucket if we move these there - related JIRA: https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/PYCBC-815
// Currently this is per-Collection but we may start sharing
// LCB instances over multiple Collections, with a couchbase.bucket.Bucket
// owning the shared LCB 'Bucket-type' instance

In addition to the connection string, the [.api]`couchbase_core.client.Client` object offers a few object attributes which can be used to configure settings during runtime:

* `timeout` for key-value operation timeouts (equivalent to `operation_timeout` in the connection string)
* `views_timeout` to adjust the timeout for MapReduce queries
* `n1ql_timeout` to adjust the timeout for N1QL querties

// TODO: enable when LCB3 settings are available - related JIRA: https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/PYCBC-814
// Below follows the C settings section:
