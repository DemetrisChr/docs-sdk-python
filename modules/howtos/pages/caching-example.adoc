= Caching Example Use Case

[abstract]
A walk-through of the basics of Key-Value operations with Couchbase, through the lens of a REST api caching layer.

This example uses https://pypi.org/project/Flask/[Flask] as a web-framework for a Python REST API. 
Flask has no direct support for async, but another code sample is available demonstrating this whole application using the Couchbase async API https://github.com/couchbase/docs-sdk-python/blob/release/3.0/modules/howtos/examples/caching_async.py[here]. 
You can also find the https://github.com/couchbase/docs-sdk-python/blob/release/3.0/modules/howtos/examples/caching_flask.py[full code for _this_ example here].

== Basic endpoint
Our first basic endpoints will be a get and set call, using HTTP methods `GET` and `POST` and Couchbase methods `get` and `insert` respectively:

[source,python]
----
@app.route("/<key>", methods=["GET"]) 
def get(key):
    res = COLLECTION.get(key)
    return flask.jsonify(res.content_as[dict])

@app.route("/<key>", methods=["POST"]) 
def post(key):
    COLLECTION.insert(key, flask.request.json, expiration = EXPIRY)
    return "OK"
----

This is the simplest API we can make -- allowing us to set and get arbitrary JSON from any key we specify. 
We also include the `expiration` parameter, which will automatically delete the document (invalidate the cache) after a set amount of time.

There are many ways this can and should be improved upon for real world use. 
What happens in the case of a cache miss? 
With this code, our view throws an error and Flask returns us a HTTP 500 page.
We can fix this by handling the `KeyNotFoundException` thrown by the get call; 
then we can either respond with a HTTP 404, or add a function to get a value from persistent storage:

[source,python]
----
@app.route("/<key>", methods=["GET"]) 
def get(key):
    try:
        res = COLLECTION.get(key)
        return flask.jsonify(res.content_as[dict])
    except KeyNotFoundException:
        val = getFromPersistent(key)
        return flask.jsonify(val)
        # alternatively...
        # return "Key not found", 404
----

We can also improve the POST function to deal with some of the errors it may encounter. 
Even if something unexpected happens, we can still be helpful by including the error in the 500 response, and by catching any `CouchbaseError` as a fallback:

[source,python]
----
include::example$[tag=post]
----

The last thing we'll do is add `PUT` and `DELETE` endpoints, matching up to the Couchbase operations `upsert` and `remove`, and apply the same error handling once more:

[source,python]
----
include::example$[tag=put]

include::example$[tag=del]
    except CouchbaseError as e:
        return "Unexpected error: {}".format(e), 500
----
