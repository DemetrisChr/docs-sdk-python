[abstract]
The Couchbase Python SDK offers both asyncio and Twisted APIs for async operation.

We will cover the asyncio API here initially. 
Twisted documentation will be added shortly.

For asyncio:
All operations return a `Future[T]` where `T` is the return type, with `T` generally being the same type as the synchronous equivalent. (Note, this genericisation of the `Future` type is not supported widely, yet, but the object returned is indeed a Future the value of which is of type `T`)
This is equivalent to the operation being marked `async fn(...)->T`, and
`await` ing the result will wait for the operation to complete or fail.

`Future` s are evaluated asynchronously using the familiar `await` keyword, and run in a blocking method.
If a `Future` is awaited, the method awaiting the task must have the `async` keyword in its signature.
More information can be found in Python's asyncio documentation.

Note: All examples on this page start with initiating a Cluster object and then opening the default Bucket and Collection:

[source,python]

include::example$concurrent-async-apis.py[tag=connect_and_open_collection]

== Asynchronous Programming using `await`

This is the most common and basic way for consuming Couchbase operations asynchronously via asyncio:

[source,python]
----
include::example$concurrent-async-apis.py[tag=await]
----

Note that in the `upsert` method above, an exception will be thrown if the operation fails; if it succeeds then the result will be an `MutationResult` that contains the CAS value for reuse, otherwise it can be ignored.
`get` returns a `GetResult` if it succeeds, youâ€™ll then have to use `content` or `content_as` to read the returned value.

Possibly TODO: not implemented yet
== Batching

Asynchronous clients inherently batch operations: because the application receives the response at a later stage in the application, batching will be the result of issuing many requests in sequence. 

Batching in .NET using TAP is relively simple.
`await Task.WhenAll()` will group together tasks and wait until they are complete before running, 
useful where you do not want the main thread to run through the main method before getting the results back.

[source,dotnet]
----
// collection of things that will complete in the future
var tasks = new List<Task>();

// create tasks to be executed concurrently
// NOTE: these tasks have not yet been scheduled
for (var i = 0; i <100; i++)
{
    var task = collection.GetAsync($"mykey-{i}");
    tasks.Add(task);
}

// Waits until all of the tasks have completed
await Task.WhenAll(tasks);

// can iterate task list to get results
foreach (var task in tasks)
{
    var result = tasks.Result;
}
