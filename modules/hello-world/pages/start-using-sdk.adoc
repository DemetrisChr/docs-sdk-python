{description}

The Couchbase Python SDK allows Python applications to access a Couchbase cluster.
It offers a traditional synchronous API as well as integration with _twisted_ and _asyncio_.

In this guide, you will learn:

* How to xref:connect[connect to Couchbase Capella or Couchbase Server].

* How to xref:add-and-retrieve-documents[add and retrieve Documents].

* How to xref:sql-lookup[lookup documents] with the {sqlpp_url}[{sqlpp} (formerly N1QL)] query language.

== Hello Couchbase

We will go through the code sample step by step, but for those in a hurry to see it, here it is:

[{tabs}] 
==== 
Couchbase Capella Sample::
+
--
To connect to xref:cloud::index.adoc[Couchbase Capella], be sure to get the correct endpoint as well as user, password, and bucket name.
The certificate for connecting to Capella is included in the 4.1 Python SDK.

[source,python]
----
include::hello-world:example$cloud.py[tags=**]
----
--

Local Couchbase Server::
+ 
--
[source,python]
----
include::hello-world:example$hello_world_t.py[tags=**]
----

As well as the Python SDK (see below), and a running instance of Couchbase Server, you will need to load up the Travel Sample Bucket
using either the xref:{version-server}@server:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-ui[Web interface]
or the xref:{version-server}@server:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-cli[command line].
--
====

The https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-up[Couchbase Capella free trial] version comes with the Travel Sample Bucket, and its Query indexes, loaded and ready.

== Quick Installation

The SDK will run on Python 3.7 - 3.10.
A more detailed guide in our xref:project-docs:sdk-full-installation.adoc[Installation page] covers every supported platform, but this section should be enough to get up and running in most cases.

[{tabs}] 
====
macOS 11 & 12::
+
--
If you are running Catalina (macOS 10.15) -- or have other detailed requirements -- take a look at our xref:project-pages:sdk-full-installation.adoc[full installation guide].
Otherwise, read on for a quick install on macOS _Big Sur_ or _Monterey_.

As of the 4.0.1 release of the Python SDK, wheels are available for Python 3.7 - 3.10.

First, make sure that your _brew_ package index is up-to-date:
[source,console]
----
$ brew update
----

Install a compatible Python 3:
[source,console]
----
$ brew install openssl@1.1 python3
----

Ensure that the Python installation can be called from the shell:
[source,console]
----
$ echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:"$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc
----

Now, install the Python SDK:
[source,console]
----
$ sudo -H python3 -m pip install couchbase
----
--

Red Hat & CentOS::
+
--
Note, check that you have a supported version of Python (3.7 - 3.10).
Suggestions for platforms with an outdated build chain, such as CentOS 7, can be found in our xref:project-docs:sdk-full-installation.adoc[Installation Guide].
Assuming you have an updated build environment, follow these steps.

As of the 4.0.2 release of the Python SDK, manylinux wheels are available for Python 3.7 - 3.10.

During first-time setup, install the prerequisites:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ git python3-devel python3-pip openssl-devel
----
Full details of prerequisites can be found xref:project-docs:sdk-full-installation.adoc#requirements[here].

Now you can install the latest Python SDK (for older versions, see the xref:project-docs:sdk-release-notes.adoc[Release Notes page]):

[source,console]
----
$ python3 -m pip install couchbase
----
--

Debian & Ubuntu::
+
--
Note, check that you have a supported version of Python (3.7 - 3.10).
Suggestions for platforms with an outdated build chain, such as Debian 9, can be found in our xref:project-docs:sdk-full-installation.adoc[Installation Guide].
Assuming you have an updated build environment, follow these steps.

As of the 4.0.2 release of the Python SDK, manylinux wheels are available for Python 3.7 - 3.10.

During first-time setup, install the prerequisites:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt-get install git python3-dev python3-pip python3-setuptools build-essential libssl-dev
----
Full details of prerequisites can be found xref:project-docs:sdk-full-installation.adoc#requirements[here].

Now you can install the latest Python SDK (for older versions, see the xref:project-docs:sdk-release-notes.adoc[Release Notes page]):

[source,console]
----
$ python3 -m pip install couchbase
----
--

Windows::
+
--
Download and install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads[python.org^].  
Best practice is to use a Python virtual environment such as _venv_ or _pyenv_.

TIP: Checkout the https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win[pyenv-win^] project to manage multiple versions of Python.

Wheels are available on Windows for Python 3.7 - 3.10.

[source,console]
----
python -m pip install couchbase
----

The standard Python distributions for Windows include OpenSSL DLLs, as PIP and the inbuilt `ssl` module require it for correct operation.
The binary wheels for Windows are packaged as a binary wheel built against OpenSSL.

NOTE: If you require a version that doesn't have a suitable binary wheel on PyPi, follow the https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-python-client#alternative-installation-methods[build instructions] on the GitHub repo.

====

If there are any problems, refer to the full xref:project-docs:sdk-full-installation.adoc[Installation page].


// TODO: There's not much in the Platform Help page, we should avoid pointing users to it for now.
// TIP: If you are evaluating the Python SDK as a tester, architect, or otherwise not a regular Python developer, our xref:platform-help.adoc[Platform Help] pages may help get you over any humps in the road.

== Prerequisites

The following code samples assume:

[{tabs}]
====
Couchbase Capella::
+
--
* You have signed up to https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-up[Couchbase Capella].

* You have created your own bucket, or loaded the Travel Sample dataset.
Note, the Travel Sample dataset is installed automatically by the Capella free trial.

* A user is created with permissions to access the cluster (at least Application Access permissions).
See the xref:cloud:get-started:cluster-and-data.adoc#credentials[Capella connection page] for more details.

IMPORTANT: Couchbase Capella uses xref:cloud:organizations:organization-projects-overview.adoc[Roles] to control user access to database resources.
For the purposes of this guide, you can use the *Organization Owner* role automatically assigned to your account during installation of the Capella cluster.
In a production scenario, we strongly recommend setting up users with more granular access roles as a best practice.
--

Local Couchbase Server::
+
--
* xref:{version-server}@server:getting-started/do-a-quick-install.adoc[Couchbase Server] is installed and accessible locally.

* You have created your own bucket, or loaded the Travel Sample dataset using the xref:{version-server}@server:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-ui[Web interface].

* A user is created with permissions to access your cluster (at least Application Access permissions).
See xref:{version-server}@server:manage:manage-security/manage-users-and-roles.adoc[Manage Users, Groups and Roles] for more details.

IMPORTANT: Couchbase Server uses xref:{version-server}@server:learn:security/roles.adoc[Role Based Access Control (RBAC)] to control access to resources.
In this guide we suggest using the *Full Admin* role created during setup of your local Couchbase Server cluster.
For production client code, you will want to use more appropriate, restrictive settings.
--
====

== Step-by-Step

At this point we want to transition from the terminal to your code editor of choice.

Let's now create an empty file named `cb-test.py` and walk through adding code step-by-step.

Here are all the import statements that you will need to run the sample code:

[source,python,indent=0]
----
include::example$cloud.py[tag=imports]
----

=== Connect

The basic connection details that you'll need are given below -- for more background information, refer to the xref:howtos:managing-connections.adoc#connection-strings[Managing Connections page].

[tabs]
====
Couchbase Capella::
+
--

From version 4.0, the Python SDK includes Capellaâ€™s standard certificates by default, so you don't need any additional configuration.
You do need to enable TLS, which can be done by simply using `couchbases://` in the connection string as in this example.

[source,python]
----
include::example$cloud.py[tag=connect,indent=0]
----

When accessing Capella from a different Wide Area Network or Availability Zone, you may experience latency issues with the default connection settings.
SDK 4.1 introduces a `wan_development` Configuration Profile, which provides pre-configured timeout settings suitable for working in high latency environments.
Basic usage is shown in the example above, but if you want to learn more see xref:ref:client-settings.adoc#constrained-network-environments[Constrained Network Environments].

CAUTION: The Configuration Profiles feature is currently a xref:python-sdk:project-docs:compatibility.adoc#interface-stability[Volatile API] and may be subject to change.
--

Local Couchbase Server::
+
--
[source,python]
----
include::example$hello_world_t.py[tag=connect,indent=0]
----

For developing locally on the same machine as Couchbase Server, your URI can be `couchbase://localhost`.
For production deployments, you will want to use a secure server, with `couchbases://`.
--
====

Following successful authentication, add this code snippet to access your `Bucket`:

[source,python]
----
include::example$cloud.py[tag=bucket,indent=0]
----

=== Add and Retrieve Documents

The Python SDK supports full integration with the xref:concept-docs:collections.adoc[Collections] feature introduced in Couchbase Server 7.0.
*Collections* allow documents to be grouped by purpose or theme, according to a specified _Scope_.

Here we refer to the `users` collection within the `tenant_agent_00` scope from the Travel Sample bucket as an example, but you may replace this with your own data.

[source,python]
----
include::example$cloud.py[tag=collection,indent=0]
----

The code shows how you would use a named collection and scope.

.For Local Couchbase Server only
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `default_collection` must be used when connecting to a 6.6 cluster or earlier.

[source,python]
----
include::example$hello_world_t.py[tag=default-collection,indent=0]
----
====

Let's create a dictionary object in our application that we can add to our `travel-sample` bucket that conforms to the structure of a document of type `airline`.

[source,python]
----
include::example$cloud.py[tag=test-doc,indent=0]
----

xref:howtos:kv-operations.adoc[Data operations], such as storing and retrieving documents, can be done using simple methods on the `Collection` class such as `Collection.get` and `Collection.upsert`.
Simply pass the key (and value, if applicable) to the relevant methods.

The following function will _upsert_ a document and print the returned xref:howtos:concurrent-document-mutations.adoc[CAS] value:

[source,python]
----
include::example$cloud.py[tag=upsert-func,indent=0]
----

Call the `upsert_document()` function passing in our `airline` document:

[source,python]
----
include::example$cloud.py[tag=upsert-invoke,indent=0]
----

Now let's retrieve that document using a key-value operation.
The following function runs a `get()` for a document key and either logs out the result or error in our console:

[source,python]
----
include::example$cloud.py[tag=get-func,indent=0]
----

Call the `get_airline_by_key` function passing in our valid document key `airline_8091`:

[source,python]
----
include::example$cloud.py[tag=get-invoke,indent=0]
----

=== SQL++ Lookup

Couchbase {sqlpp} queries can be performed at the `Cluster` or `Scope` level by invoking `Cluster.query()` or `Scope.query()`.

Cluster level queries require you to specify the fully qualified keyspace each time (e.g. `travel-sample.inventory.airline`).
However, with a Scope level query you only need to specify the Collection name -- which in this case is `airline`:

[source,python]
----
include::example$cloud.py[tag=lookup-func,indent=0]
----

We call the `lookup_by_callsign` function passing in our callsign `CBS`:

[source,python]
----
include::example$cloud.py[tag=lookup-invoke,indent=0]
----

=== Execute!

Now we can run our code using the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ python3 cb-test.py
----

The results you should expect are as follows:

[source,console]
----
Upsert CAS:
1598469741559152640

Get Result:
{'type': 'airline', 'id': 8091, 'callsign': 'CBS', 'iata': None, 'icao': None, 'name': 'Couchbase Airways'}

Lookup Result:
Couchbase Airways
----
